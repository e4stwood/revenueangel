Check background job setup - something doesnt seem right about the way its coonfigured (see initial imp - it wants it deployed seperately, should we add a docker file or somerthing and an automated seperate deployment?)

Actually deploy the app and test it and make sure it works in our whop?

Look at plan and implementations - work out whats next?

I think we need a way to setup playbook - look at initial imp - its sort of saying do it via the api ? why ? 
do we need an onboaridng flow?

Entry point / onboarding ui still talks about the og app ? maybe ?
